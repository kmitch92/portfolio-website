**Personal Profile**

I began programming during the COVID period and fell in love with it due to the endless supply of new concepts and tools to master. I have pursued a number of both creative and scientific pursuits in my life and have always found each to be lacking elements found in the other: In programming both inclinations are required in equal measure. I will continue learning tirelessly **in any role and applying my creativity and analytical ability to the projects that I work on.**
